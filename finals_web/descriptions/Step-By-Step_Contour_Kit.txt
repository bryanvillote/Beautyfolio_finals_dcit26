An easy-to-use face-contour palette that sculpts, shapes, and makes your features pop with a set of bronzer, highlighter, and contour powders.

Usage:
For the nose:
-Using the contour shade, apply two lines down the sides of your nose, starting near the beginning of your brow and ending at the tip of your nose.
-Blend product to create shadows for a slimming effect.
-Using the highlighting shade, accentuate the bridge by applying a thin line from the top to the ball of your nose and blend. This draws the light to the center of your nose, making it look straighter.
-To make the nose look shorter: Apply the contour shade to the very tip and underneath the tip between your nostrils to add shadows for the illusion of a shorter nose.

For the cheeks:
-Suck in your cheeks to find the perfect hollow from your ear to the corner of your mouth.
-Using the contour shade, apply along this line and blend upward to create the illusion of sculpted cheeks by creating shadows.
-Blend upwards to instantly give the illusion of a facelift.
-Apply blush right above the contoured line—on the apples of your cheeks—to create a naturally flushed look.

For the jawline:
-Apply the contour shade underneath your jawline to square off your chin for a more sculpted look.

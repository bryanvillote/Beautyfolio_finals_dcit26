A new way to contour starts here with little pots of contour perfection.

Usage:
Shape:
-There’s no need to be an MUA to contour like a pro. Before foundation, using your fingers or beauty sponge, apply the cream contour in gentle patting motions to the areas you wish to shape and sculpt.
-Try product on cheekbones, on your temples, along your hairline, down the sides of your nose, and along your jawline.
-Keep contour light and fresh to lift and not hollow the structure of your gorgeous face.

Set:
-Once you’ve shaped, apply your foundation or tinted moisturizer using your beauty sponge in pressing motions.
-The cream contour will pull through your foundation for a stunning "under-painted" effect.

Seal:
-Sweep the powder finisher across the areas you have cream-contoured for an ultimate seamless finish.
-Get ready to reawaken your contour for the most natural-looking, soft-focus finish yet.

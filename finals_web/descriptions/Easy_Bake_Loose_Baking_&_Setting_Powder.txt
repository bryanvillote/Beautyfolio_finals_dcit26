A lightly pigmented, silky setting powder that bakes & sets, blurs the look of fine lines, and locks in makeup for 10 hours with an airbrushed finish.

Usage:
Easy Bake is easy to use thanks to its unique powder net, which disperses a controlled amount of powder. By following Huda’s step-by-step guide, you’ll be able to brighten and revitalize the look of your under-eye area, while also enhancing the contours of your face.

BAKE: After applying concealer, apply a generous layer of powder under the eye, on the T-zone, laugh lines, outer corners of the mouth, and chin. Let the powder sit for 3-5 minutes before dusting off excess.

SET: After applying concealer, lightly dust powder all over the face; concentrating more of the product under the eye and on oily areas, such as the T-zone.

TOUCH UP: Use product to touch up and control shine throughout the day, without the cake. ** Try our Baby Bakes to touch up on-the-go!**
